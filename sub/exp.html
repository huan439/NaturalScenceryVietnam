        <h2>WHAT TO DO ON A HOLIDAY TO VIETNAM?</h2>
        <p>There is plenty to do when holidaying in Vietnam; in fact, the country is much more diverse than many people think. Broadly speaking, the north of the country is brilliant for glorious scenery; the mountains of Sapa are perfect for luxury cycling holidays or walking, while the dramatic limestone karsts of Halong Bay are perfect for sailing. The north is also where you’ll find the vibrant capital of Hanoi. The centre is ideal for beaches or cultural exploration, with ancient cities and stunning coast. By contrast, the south is where you’ll find modern Ho Chi Minh City, the lush Mekong Delta, and the popular island of Phu Quoc.</p>
